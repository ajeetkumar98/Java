Q1. What is Java?

	Java is a high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle).
	It is designed to be platform-independent, secure, robust, and portable, making it suitable for enterprise, web, mobile, and cloud applications.

Q2. Why is Java platform-independent?

	Java is platform-independent because it does not compile directly into machine code.
	Instead:

	Java source code → Bytecode

	Bytecode runs on JVM

	Each OS has its own JVM

	So the same bytecode runs on Windows, Linux, or Mac.

Q3. What is bytecode in Java?

	Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-neutral code generated by the Java compiler (javac).
	It is stored in .class files and executed by the JVM.

Q4. Why does Java use bytecode instead of direct machine code?

	Enables Write Once Run Anywhere

	Improves security (bytecode verification)

	Allows JIT optimization

	Makes Java portable

Q5. What is JVM and what does it do?

	JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a runtime engine that:

	Loads class files

	Verifies bytecode

	Executes bytecode

	Manages memory (heap & stack)

	Performs garbage collection

	👉 JVM is platform-dependent, but Java is not.

Q6. Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM?
	Component	Explanation
	JVM	Executes bytecode
	JRE	JVM + core libraries
	JDK	JRE + compiler + dev tools

	👉 Developers need JDK, users need JRE.

Q7. What is WORA?

	WORA means Write Once, Run Anywhere.
	Java code written once can run on any platform that has a JVM without modification.

Q8. Why is Java more secure than C/C++?

	No pointers

	Automatic memory management

	Bytecode verification

	Security Manager

	No direct memory access

	This prevents buffer overflows and memory corruption.

Q9. Role of JIT compiler?

	JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler:

	Converts frequently executed bytecode into native machine code

	Improves performance

	Avoids repeated interpretation

Q10. What is a Java compiler and what does it produce?

	Java compiler (javac) converts:

	.java → .class (bytecode)


	It checks syntax and semantic errors at compile time.

Q11. What are tokens in Java?

	Tokens are the smallest building blocks of Java programs.

	Types:

	Keywords

	Identifiers

	Operators

	Literals

	Separators

Q12. What are identifiers? Rules?

	Identifiers are names for variables, methods, classes.

	Rules:

	Must start with letter, _, or $

	No spaces

	Cannot be keywords

	Case-sensitive

Q13. Difference between keyword and identifier?
	Keyword	Identifier
	Reserved	User-defined
	Fixed meaning	Custom meaning
	
Q14. Why must main() be static?

	Because JVM calls main() without creating an object.
	Static allows method invocation using class name.

Q15. Structure of a Java program
	class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			// logic
		}
	}


	Class → main method → executable statements

Q16. What are primitive data types?

	Primitive data types store simple values directly in memory.

	8 types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Q17. What are non-primitive data types?

	They store references to objects.

	Examples: String, Array, Class, Interface

Q18. Why is String not primitive?

	Because String is:

	A class

	Immutable

	Has methods

	Stored as object in heap

Q19. What is a variable?

	A variable is a named memory location whose value can change during execution.

Q20. Difference between local, instance, static variables?
	Type	Memory	Scope
	Local	Stack	Method
	Instance	Heap	Object
	Static	Method area	Class
Q21. What is a wrapper class?

	Wrapper classes convert primitives into objects.

	Example:

	int → Integer

	Used in:

	Collections

	Generics

	Frameworks

Q22. What is autoboxing?

	Automatic conversion of primitive → wrapper object.

Q23. What is unboxing?

	Automatic conversion of wrapper → primitive.

Q24. What are operators?

	Operators perform operations on operands.

	Types:

	Arithmetic

	Relational

	Logical

	Assignment

	Unary

Q25. Difference between == and .equals()?
	==	.equals()
	Reference comparison	Content comparison

Q26. What is short-circuiting?

	Stops evaluation when result is already known.
	Improves performance and avoids errors.

Q27. What is type casting?

	Converting one data type to another.

Q28. What is widening?

	Small → large type
	Automatic and safe.

Q29. What is narrowing?

	Large → small type
	Manual and unsafe.

Q30. Why narrowing not automatic?

	Because it may cause data loss.

Q31. What happens when double is cast to int?

	Decimal part is truncated.

Q32. What is type promotion?

	Java promotes smaller data types to larger types during expression evaluation.

Q33. Input using Scanner
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

Q34. Difference between nextInt() & nextLine()?

	nextInt() skips newline
	nextLine() reads entire line

Q35. Purpose of Math class

	Provides predefined mathematical functions.

Q36. 3 Math methods

	sqrt()

	pow()

	max()

Q37. Built-in packages

	Predefined packages like java.lang, java.util.

Q38. User-defined packages

	Packages created to organize classes logically.

Q39. What are access modifiers?

	They control visibility and accessibility.

Q40. Explain access modifiers
	Modifier	Scope
	public	Everywhere
	protected	Package + subclass
	default	Package only
	private	Same class

Q41. IPO cycle

	Input → Process → Output
	Basic program execution model.

Q42. What happens during compilation?

	Source code → bytecode
	Errors checked.

Q43. What happens during execution?

	JVM loads, verifies, interprets, JIT compiles.

Q44. Use of System.out.println()

	Prints output to standard output stream.

Q45. Why main method needed?

	JVM starts execution from main method.

Q46. Can Java run without main()?

	❌ No (except frameworks or JVM-internal cases)

	🔥 INTERVIEW TIP

	If interviewer asks:

“Explain Java in 1 line”

Answer:

Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented language that uses bytecode and JVM to achieve portability, security, and performance.
