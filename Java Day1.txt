What is programming ?
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to make it perform tasks.
Programming is telling a computer what to do.


Static and Dynamic language.
Static Language:
Type checking happens at compile time.
Example: Java, C, C++
Errors are caught early.


Dynamic Language:
Type checking happens at runtime.
Example: Python, JavaScript
More flexible, but errors appear while running.


compiler
A compiler is a program that converts high-level code (like Java/C++) into machine code before execution.
Checks errors during compile time
Makes the program run faster.


Interpreter
An interpreter executes code line by line.
Errors are found during execution
Slower than a compiler
Used in languages like Python, JavaScript


JAVA and its feature
A high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

Features of Java:
Platform Independent – Write once, run anywhere.
Object-Oriented – Uses classes and objects.
Simple & Easy – Easy to learn syntax.
Secure – Built-in security features.
Robust – Strong memory management.
Multithreaded – Can run multiple tasks at once.
High Performance – Uses JIT compiler.
Portable – Same code works on any machine.


JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
A part of Java that runs Java programs.

What it does:
Converts bytecode to machine code
Manages memory
Provides security
Makes Java platform independent

In short: JVM runs the Java program.


JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
It provides everything needed to run a Java program.

Includes:
JVM
Libraries
Runtime components

In short: JRE = JVM + Libraries (for running Java applications).


JDK (Java Development Kit):
It is the tool used to develop Java programs.

Includes:
JRE
JVM
Development tools (compiler javac, debugger, etc.)

In short: JDK = JRE + Tools (for developing Java applications).


JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler):
A part of JVM that converts bytecode into machine code at runtime for faster execution.

In short: JIT makes Java programs run faster.


Stack and Heap memory

Stack Memory:
Stores method calls, local variables
Faster
Memory is automatically cleared when a method ends

Heap Memory:
Stores objects and instance variables
Slower
Managed by Garbage Collector

Simple:
Stack = temporary data
Heap = objects data


Garbage Collector(GC)
A Java program that automatically removes unused objects from Heap memory.

Purpose:
Frees memory
Prevents memory leaks
Makes Java memory management automatic

In short: GC cleans unused objects to free space.


Primitive and Non-primitive Datatype

Primitive Data Types:
Built-in, simple data types
Store single values
Fast and memory-efficient

Examples: int, float, char, Boolean, byte, short, long, double

Non-Primitive Data Types:
Created by users
Store multiple values or objects
Can grow in size

Examples: String, arrays, classes, objects, interfaces, collections

Simple:
Primitive = basic values
Non-primitive = objects and complex types
