2 Tokens in Java

	In programming, a token is the smallest individual unit of source code that is meaningful to a compiler or interpreter. It is a sequence of characters that represents a specific element in the program, such as a keyword, identifier, operator, literal, or punctuation symbol. 
		Every Java program is made up of tokens.

	Java has 6 types of tokens:

		🔶 1. Keywords

			These are predefined, reserved words in Java.
			You cannot use them as variable names or method names.

		✔ Examples
			int, class, static, public, void, if, else, return, try, catch
			✔ Example in code
			class Student {
				int age;
			}

		🔶 2. Identifiers

			Names given by the programmer to:
				Variables // A variable is a memory container used to store data values.
				Methods
				Classes
				Objects
				Interfaces

			✔ Examples
				age, sum, Student, calculateTotal()
			✔ Rules
			Cannot start with a number
			Cannot use keywords
			Case-sensitive
			Can contain letters, digits, _, $

		🔶 3. Literals

		Constant values written directly in code.
			✔ Types of literals

			Integer literal → 10, 50
			Floating literal → 12.5, 3.14f
			Character literal → 'A', 'z'
			String literal → "Hello"
			Boolean literal → true, false
			✔ Example
			int x = 10;
			String s = "Java";

		🔶 4. Operators

			Symbols used to perform operations.
			✔ Types
			Arithmetic → + - * / %
			Relational → > < == !=
			Logical → && || !
			Assignment → = += -=
			Increment / Decrement → ++ --
			✔ Example
			int a = 10 + 5;

		🔶 5. Separators / Symbols

			Characters used to separate code elements.
			✔ Examples
			Semicolon → ;
			Comma → ,
			Dot → .
			Brackets → ()
			Curly braces → {}
			Square brackets → []
			✔ Example
			System.out.println("Hello");

		🔶 6. Comments

			Used to explain code.
			Ignored by the compiler.
			✔ Types
			Single-line comment
			// This is a comment
			Multi-line comment
			/*
			   Multiple lines comment
			*/

	Automatic	✔ Yes			✖ No
	Data Loss	✖ No			✔ Yes (possible)
	Syntax		automatic		requires cast (type)
	
	
0.8 Packages & Access Modifiers
	Types of Packages

	Built-in: java.util, java.io

	User-defined
	Access modifiers
	Modifier	Same Class	Same Package	Child Class		Other Package
	public		✔	 		✔				✔				✔
	protected	✔			✔				✔				✖
	default		✔			✔				✖				✖
	private		✔			✖				✖				✖
	
	
0.9 Wrapper Classes

	Used to convert primitive → object.

		Examples
		int → Integer
		double → Double
		boolean → Boolean
		Autoboxing
		Integer x = 10;
		Unboxing
		int y = x;
		
System.out.println() — Line-by-Line Explanation
	1️⃣ System

		System is a built-in class in Java.
		It belongs to the java.lang package, so you don’t need to import it.
		This class contains useful tools like:
			in → for input
			out → for output
			err → for error messages

	2️⃣ System.out

		out is a static variable inside the System class.
		It represents the standard output stream.
		Means: whatever you print using out will go to
		console / terminal / command prompt.

	Technically:

		out is an object of class PrintStream.
		PrintStream has methods like:
		print()
		println()
		printf()

	3️⃣ System.out.println()

		println() is a method of PrintStream.
		It prints the message and moves cursor to the next line.

	📌 Example:
		System.out.println("Hello");
		System.out.println("World");
		Output:
		Hello
		World

	(printed on two different lines)
	
	4️⃣ What println() actually does
		Sends the text to the output stream (out)
		Converts non-string values (int, float, boolean) to string
		Adds a newline at the end (\n)
		
		
		
✅ Difference Between out, in, and err in Java
	1️⃣ System.out — Standard Output Stream

		Used to print normal messages to the console.
		Example: results, logs, information, general output.
		Type: PrintStream
		Example:
		System.out.println("Hello, Java!");

	2️⃣ System.in — Standard Input Stream

		Used to take input from the keyboard.
		Type: InputStream
		Works with classes like Scanner or BufferedReader.
		Example:
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	3️⃣ System.err — Standard Error Stream

		Used to print error messages.
		Also prints to the console, but it's separate from normal output.
		Helps identify errors easily.
		Type: PrintStream (same as out)

about main method	
			
	What is the main method in Java?

		The main method is the starting point (entry point) of every Java program.
		The main method is a public and static method that JVM calls first when the program starts, it returns nothing, and it can take extra input from the command-line.

		Java always begins execution from:
		public static void main(String[] args)

	🔍 Line-by-Line Explanation
	
	1️⃣ public
		public means anyone can access this method.
		JVM must be able to access it, so it must be public.
	➡ Without public, JVM cannot call your main method.

	2️⃣ static

		static means the method belongs to the class, not objects.
		JVM can call it without creating an object of the class.
	➡ If it was not static, JVM would need to create an object first — but JVM doesn’t do that.

	3️⃣ void

		void means the method does NOT return anything.
		The main method does not give any output back to JVM.

	➡ It only runs your code.

	4️⃣ main

		main is the name of the method.
		JVM looks for this exact name to start the program.

	➡ If you change the name, the program won't run.

	5️⃣ (String[] args)

		This is the parameter for the main method.
		String[]
			An array of Strings.
		args
			Variable name (can be anything like a, data, x).
		It stores command-line arguments.

	➡ If you run your program with extra values, they come inside args.

	Example:
		java MyClass hello 123
	Then:
		args[0] = "hello"
		args[1] = "123"


🟩 2️⃣ Stack Memory — Fast Working Table

	Think of the stack as a small table where Java keeps things temporarily.
	
	What is stored in the Stack?
		Local variables (inside methods)
		Method calls (which method is running)
		References (address of objects)
		
🟩 2️⃣ Heap Memory — Big Storage Room

	Heap is like a large storage room where Java keeps all objects.

	What is stored in the Heap?
		Objects
		Arrays
		Class objects
		Strings ( some in the String Pool )

	Who manages Heap memory?
	➡ Garbage Collector (GC)
	
🟨 3️⃣ Method Area / MetaSpace — Class Information Storage

	This is the memory where Java stores information about classes.

	What is stored in the Method Area?

		Class names
		Method names
		Method code
		Static variables
		Constant Pool
	✔ Managed by the JVM
	✔ After Java 8, this area is called MetaSpace
	✔ It can grow as needed using OS memory
