# Java Fundamentals – Question & Answer Notes

1. What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal language used to give instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.

What are the main types of programming languages?

1. Low-Level Language

    Low-level languages are close to "machine hardware".

    Characteristics:

    * Difficult to understand
    * Faster execution
    * Hardware dependent

    Examples:

    * Machine Language (0s and 1s)
    * Assembly Language

2. High-Level Language:
    High-level languages are easy for humans to "read, write, and understand".

    Characteristics:

    * User-friendly syntax
    * Platform independent (mostly)
    * Slightly slower than low-level languages

    Examples:

    * Java
    * Python
    * C++

3. Procedural Language

    Procedural languages follow a "step-by-step procedure" to solve problems.

    Characteristics:

    * Focus on functions/procedures
    * Code executed sequentially
    * Less security

    Examples:

    * C
    * Pascal

4. Object-Oriented Language

    Object-oriented languages organize code using "objects and classes".

    Key concepts:

    * Class
    * Object
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism
    * Encapsulation
    * Abstraction

    Advantages:

    * Code reusability
    * Better security
    * Easy maintenance

    Examples:

    * Java
    * C++
    * Python

5. Scripting Language

    Scripting languages are mainly used for "automation and web development".

    Characteristics:

    * Interpreted
    * No compilation needed
    * Faster development

    Examples:

    * Python
    * JavaScript
    * Bash

2. What is a Static Typed Language?

    A static typed language is one in which data types are checked at "compile time".

    Example: Java, C, C++

    ```java
    int a = 10;
    ```

    Advantages:

    * Better performance
    * Early error detection

3. What is a Dynamic Typed Language?

    A dynamic typed language is one in which data types are checked at "runtime".

    Example: Python, JavaScript

    ```python
    a = 10
    ```

    Advantages:

    * Easy to write
    * Flexible coding

4. What is Java?

Java is a "high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent" programming language.

5. What are the features of Java?

    * Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
    * Object Oriented
    * Secure
    * Robust
    * Multithreaded
    * Portable
    * High Performance
    * Automatic Garbage Collection

6. What is a Compiler?

    A "compiler" converts source code into bytecode.

    ```
    .java → .class
    ```

    * Java compiler is "javac"
    * Checks syntax errors
    * Executes once

7. What is an Interpreter?

    An "interpreter" executes code line by line.

    In Java:

    * JVM interprets bytecode
    * Helps in debugging

8. What is JVM?

    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.

    Main functions of JVM:

    * Loads class files
    * Verifies bytecode
    * Executes program
    * Manages memory

    Components:

    * Class Loader
    * Execution Engine
    * Runtime Data Areas
    * Garbage Collector

9. What is JRE?

    JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the environment required to "run Java programs".

    Includes:

    * JVM
    * Java libraries

    ❌ Cannot compile Java programs

10. What is JDK?

    JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to "develop and run Java programs".

    Includes:

    * JRE
    * Compiler (javac)
    * Debugger
    * Development tools

    Relationship between JDK, JRE, JVM:

    ```
    JDK → JRE → JVM
    ```

11. What is JIT?

    JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler) is part of JVM that converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime to improve performance.

12. What is Stack Memory?

    Stack memory stores:

    * Method calls
    * Local variables

    Characteristics:

    * Faster
    * Follows LIFO order
    * Memory released automatically

13. What is Heap Memory?

    Heap memory stores:

    * Objects

    Characteristics:
    * Slower than stack
    * Shared among threads
    * Managed by Garbage Collector

14. What is Garbage Collector?

    Garbage Collector automatically removes unused objects from heap memory and prevents memory leaks.

    Example:

    ```java
    obj = null;
    ```

15. What are Primitive Data Types in Java?

    Primitive data types are basic data types that store simple values directly in memory.

    Types, Size, and Range:

    | Data Type | Size              | Description                   |
    | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
    | byte      | 1 byte (8 bits)   | Stores small integers         |
    | short     | 2 bytes (16 bits) | Stores small integers         |
    | int       | 4 bytes (32 bits) | Stores integers               |
    | long      | 8 bytes (64 bits) | Stores large integers         |
    | float     | 4 bytes (32 bits) | Stores decimal values         |
    | double    | 8 bytes (64 bits) | Stores precise decimal values |
    | char      | 2 bytes (16 bits) | Stores a single character     |
    | boolean   | 1 bit             | Stores true or false          |

16. What are Non-Primitive Data Types in Java?

    Non-primitive data types store references to objects.

    Examples:

    * String
    * Array
    * Class
    * Interface
    * Object

    ```java
    String name = "Ajeet";
    ```

⭐ Interview One-Line Answers

* Java is both "compiled and interpreted"
* JVM provides platform independence
* Garbage Collector manages heap memory

17. What are Tokens in Java?

    Tokens are the smallest individual units in a Java program.

    Types of Tokens in Java:
    1. Keywords

    Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in Java.

    Examples:

    * int, class, public, static, void, if, else, for, while

    ❌ Keywords cannot be used as variable names.

    2. Identifiers

    Identifiers are names given to:

    Variables, Methods, Classes

    Rules:

    * Must not start with a digit
    * No spaces allowed
    * Cannot be a keyword

    Example:

    int number = 10;

    Here, number is an identifier.

    3. Operators

    Operators are symbols used to perform operations.

    Types of Operators:

    Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

    Relational: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

    Logical: &&, ||, !

    Assignment: =, +=, -=

    4. Literals

    Literals are fixed values assigned to variables.

    Examples:

    Integer literal: 10

    Floating literal: 3.14

    Character literal: 'A'

    String literal: "Java"

    Boolean literal: true, false

    5. Comments

    Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler.

    Types:

    Single-line comment: // comment

    Multi-line comment: /* comment */

    Documentation comment: /** comment */

    6. Symbols (Separators)

    Symbols are special characters used in Java syntax.

    Examples:

    ; (semicolon)

    , (comma)

    () (parentheses)

    {} (braces)

    [] (brackets)

18. What is Type Conversion in Java?

    Type conversion means converting one data type into another.

    Types of Type Conversion:
    1. Implicit Type Conversion (Widening)

    * Done automatically by Java

    * Smaller type → larger type

    Example:

    int a = 10;
    double b = a;
    2. Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing)

    Done manually by the programmer

    Larger type → smaller type

    Example:

    double x = 10.5;
    int y = (int) x;

19. What are Access Modifiers in Java?

    Access modifiers define the visibility of variables, methods, and classes.

    Types of Access Modifiers:
    Modifier	Access Level
    public	Accessible everywhere
    protected	Same package or subclass
    default	Same package only
    private	Same class only

20. Explain System.out.println() line by line
    System.out.println("Hello World");

    Explanation:

    System → Predefined class in java.lang package

    out → Static object of PrintStream class (standard output)

    println → Method to print output and move to next line

21. Difference Between out, in, and err in Java
    Stream	Purpose
    System.out	Standard output (print data)
    System.in	Standard input (take input)
    System.err	Error output (print errors)

    Example:

    System.out.println("Normal Output");
    System.err.println("Error Message");

22. What is the main Method in Java?

    The main method is the entry point of any Java program.

    Syntax:

    public static void main(String[] args)
    Explanation:

    * public → Accessible from anywhere

    static → No object needed to call main method

    void → Does not return any value

    main → JVM looks for this method

    String[] args → Command-line arguments

Tokens are the smallest units of a Java program

main method is mandatory for program execution

Access modifiers control visibility
