# Java Fundamentals – Question & Answer Notes

1. What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal language used to give instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks.

What are the main types of programming languages?

1. Low-Level Language

    Low-level languages are close to "machine hardware".

    Characteristics:

    * Difficult to understand
    * Faster execution
    * Hardware dependent

    Examples:

    * Machine Language (0s and 1s)
    * Assembly Language

2. High-Level Language:
    High-level languages are easy for humans to "read, write, and understand".

    Characteristics:

    * User-friendly syntax
    * Platform independent (mostly)
    * Slightly slower than low-level languages

    Examples:

    * Java
    * Python
    * C++

3. Procedural Language

    Procedural languages follow a "step-by-step procedure" to solve problems.

    Characteristics:

    * Focus on functions/procedures
    * Code executed sequentially
    * Less security

    Examples:

    * C
    * Pascal

4. Object-Oriented Language

    Object-oriented languages organize code using "objects and classes".

    Key concepts:

    * Class
    * Object
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism
    * Encapsulation
    * Abstraction

    Advantages:

    * Code reusability
    * Better security
    * Easy maintenance

    Examples:

    * Java
    * C++
    * Python

5. Scripting Language

    Scripting languages are mainly used for "automation and web development".

    Characteristics:

    * Interpreted
    * No compilation needed
    * Faster development

    Examples:

    * Python
    * JavaScript
    * Bash

2. What is a Static Typed Language?

    A static typed language is one in which data types are checked at "compile time".

    Example: Java, C, C++

    ```java
    int a = 10;
    ```

    Advantages:

    * Better performance
    * Early error detection

3. What is a Dynamic Typed Language?

    A dynamic typed language is one in which data types are checked at "runtime".

    Example: Python, JavaScript

    ```python
    a = 10
    ```

    Advantages:

    * Easy to write
    * Flexible coding

4. What is Java?

Java is a "high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent" programming language.

5. What are the features of Java?

    * Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
    * Object Oriented
    * Secure
    * Robust
    * Multithreaded
    * Portable
    * High Performance
    * Automatic Garbage Collection

6. What is a Compiler?

    A "compiler" converts source code into bytecode.

    ```
    .java → .class
    ```

    * Java compiler is "javac"
    * Checks syntax errors
    * Executes once

7. What is an Interpreter?

    An "interpreter" executes code line by line.

    In Java:

    * JVM interprets bytecode
    * Helps in debugging

8. What is JVM?

    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.

    Main functions of JVM:

    * Loads class files
    * Verifies bytecode
    * Executes program
    * Manages memory

    Components:

    * Class Loader
    * Execution Engine
    * Runtime Data Areas
    * Garbage Collector

9. What is JRE?

    JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the environment required to "run Java programs".

    Includes:

    * JVM
    * Java libraries

    ❌ Cannot compile Java programs

10. What is JDK?

    JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to "develop and run Java programs".

    Includes:

    * JRE
    * Compiler (javac)
    * Debugger
    * Development tools

    Relationship between JDK, JRE, JVM:

    ```
    JDK → JRE → JVM
    ```

11. What is JIT?

    JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler) is part of JVM that converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime to improve performance.

12. What is Stack Memory?

    Stack memory stores:

    * Method calls
    * Local variables

    Characteristics:

    * Faster
    * Follows LIFO order
    * Memory released automatically

13. What is Heap Memory?

    Heap memory stores:

    * Objects

    Characteristics:
    * Slower than stack
    * Shared among threads
    * Managed by Garbage Collector

14. What is Garbage Collector?

    Garbage Collector automatically removes unused objects from heap memory and prevents memory leaks.

    Example:

    ```java
    obj = null;
    ```

15. What are Primitive Data Types in Java?

    Primitive data types are basic data types that store simple values directly in memory.

    Types, Size, and Range:

    | Data Type | Size              | Description                   |
    | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
    | byte      | 1 byte (8 bits)   | Stores small integers         |
    | short     | 2 bytes (16 bits) | Stores small integers         |
    | int       | 4 bytes (32 bits) | Stores integers               |
    | long      | 8 bytes (64 bits) | Stores large integers         |
    | float     | 4 bytes (32 bits) | Stores decimal values         |
    | double    | 8 bytes (64 bits) | Stores precise decimal values |
    | char      | 2 bytes (16 bits) | Stores a single character     |
    | boolean   | 1 bit             | Stores true or false          |

16. What are Non-Primitive Data Types in Java?

    Non-primitive data types store references to objects.

    Examples:

    * String
    * Array
    * Class
    * Interface
    * Object

    ```java
    String name = "Ajeet";
    ```

⭐ Interview One-Line Answers

* Java is both "compiled and interpreted"
* JVM provides platform independence
* Garbage Collector manages heap memory
